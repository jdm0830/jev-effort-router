"""The routing engine: decide, apply, record — and fail open at every step.

Called from the ``llm_request`` middleware with the request kwargs Hermes is about to send.
The contract is narrow on purpose:

* the payload is returned **unchanged** unless a confident decision was obtained;
* nothing here raises — the host already isolates middleware exceptions, but the router also
  enforces its own budget and swallows its own errors so a slow Jev cannot stall a turn;
* one decision per user turn, replayed for the rest of that turn's tool loop.

#: Where the routing decision puts the effort on the wire, per provider.
#:
#: On Ollama:Cloud the provider profile consumes ``reasoning_config`` and emits only a top-level
#: ``reasoning_effort`` — so that is the key the grid entry must carry.
#: On OpenRouter the transport emits a nested ``reasoning: {effort: ...}`` inside ``extra_body``;
#: writing a second, top-level ``reasoning_effort`` alongside it makes OpenRouter reject the whole
#: call with ``HTTP 400: "reasoning_effort" and "reasoning.effort" are both provided with
#: conflicting values``. So on OpenRouter the effort is merged into the nested ``reasoning`` object

        middleware rewrites the same call, and makes "the request is unchanged" literally true
        on the no-route path.

        Only the top-level ``reasoning_effort`` is written for Ollama:Cloud: ``reasoning_config`` is a
        *params-level* input that the provider profile consumes to derive that top-level field
        (``agent/transports/chat_completions.py::_build_kwargs_from_profile``, then
        ``plugins/model-providers/ollama-cloud/__init__.py`` which returns only

        makes Ollama reject the entire call with "Completions.create() got an unexpected keyword
        argument 'reasoning_config'" — a hard turn failure, not a degraded route.

        For OpenRouter the effort belongs in the nested ``reasoning`` object inside ``extra_body``
        (``extra_body.reasoning.effort``), which is exactly where the transport already builds it
        (``agent/transports/chat_completions.py`` writes ``extra_body["reasoning"]`` and then
        ``api_kwargs["extra_body"] = extra_body``). Two failure modes are avoided:

        * writing a *top-level* ``reasoning_effort`` beside the transport's nested object produces two
          conflicting values on one request — ``HTTP 400: "reasoning_effort" and "reasoning.effort"
          are both provided with conflicting values``;
        * writing ``reasoning`` at the **top level** is not a wire kwarg at all —
          ``Completions.create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'reasoning'``.

        So the effort is merged into ``extra_body["reasoning"]`` (reusing the mapping the transport
        put there when present, else creating one), and neither a top-level ``reasoning`` nor a
        top-level ``reasoning_effort`` is ever emitted on OpenRouter.
