"""The provider's model catalog — the grid must never outlive the models it names.

A routing grid is static; a provider catalog is not. Providers rename and retire model ids, and a
stale entry in the grid turns a perfectly confident decision into ``HTTP 404: model "..." not
found`` — a dead turn, the one outcome this plugin exists to avoid ("a broken router must be
indistinguishable from a router that is not installed").

This module answers one narrow question: *is this model id provably absent from the provider the
request is about to go to?* It reads what the host already cached — Hermes writes the provider's
model metadata to ``<HERMES_HOME>/cache/openrouter_model_metadata.json`` — so no credential is
needed and no socket is opened. Every failure mode (no cache file, unreadable JSON, an unexpected
shape, no host at all) returns "no evidence", and the grid is trusted as before.
